# Artillery Operator

An operator to create and run distributed Artillery load tests from a Kubernetes cluster, at scale.

- It implements
  the [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/#operators-in-kubernetes).
- Created Load tests are first class Kubernetes citizens based
  on [Custom Resources](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/).
- Load tests run existing
  [Artillery test scripts](https://www.artillery.io/docs/guides/guides/test-script-reference).

You can interact with created and running load tests via `kubectl`. And, monitor them with K8s UI tools too.

__SREs__, use the Operator to set up a self-service load testing framework on any K8s cluster.

__Developers__, create and apply [CRs manifests](#loadtest-manifest) to run distributed load tests from K8s at scale.
